          ##### Description {.subtitle}

          Member of the Scale team, I participate in the automation and
          optimization of the company's internal processes to facilitate client
          application migrations in a Cloud environment for the Build and Run
          teams. I am also called upon to work on occasionally within Build and
          Run teams as reinforcement.

          #### Responsibilities {.subtitle}

          My main activities are:

            * **Identification** of tasks which can be automated,
            * **Design and development** of solutions allowing the
              implementation of the automation of tasks,
            * **Documentation** of the automated procedure to be handled by
              other teams.

          In parallel with these activities, I am also occasionally required to
          support the other teams on the following tasks:

            * **Design and deployment** of Public Cloud infrastructure (AWS,
              Scaleway, Azure) with IaC technologies (Infrastructure as Code),
            * **Administration of Kubernetes clusters** and of application
              deployment in these clusters,
            * **Monitoring informations systems** with tools such as Prometheus,
              Mimir, Loki, Grafana,
            * Containerization of client application, implementation of **CI/CD
              with GitOps tools**,
            * **Documentation and training** of the automation tools,
            * **Optimization** of application deployment and client infrastructure.

        # One of my main achievements is the implementation of an automatic
        # generation of customized documentation per client. It is based on the
        # current state of their deployed Cloud infrastructure and their
        # applications in a **Kubernetes** cluster. The goal is to help the
        # client in handling his environment Cloud as well as providing
        # up-to-date documentation to other teams for incident resolution.

          ##### Description {.subtitle}

          Within the platform development team of the LIRIS, I designed and
          implement an experimentation platform dedicated to research projects.


          This platform will allows researchers to easily deploy and run their
          experiments on large-scale computer clusters and gather reproducible
          results.


          This project is called PAGoDA, which stands for
          **P**lateforme à base de plugins pour les **A**pplication bi**G**
          **D**ata **A**nalytics (Plugins based platform for big data
          analytics applications).

          ##### Responsibilities {.subtitle}

          Regarding the __[PAGoDA][pagoda]__ platform project, my main
          activities were:


            * Hardware and software architecture design of the platform,
            * Setup tools to automate platform management, mainly
              via __Ansible__ to:
                * Deploy the virtualized platform (OpenStack),
                * Deploy and configure containerization and orchestration
                  tools, such as __Docker__, __Rancher__, __Kubernetes__,
            * Evaluation of different monitoring systems and setup prototype
              of the platform monitoring using __Prometheus__, __Grafana__
              and the __Elastic Stack__,
            * Write technical documentation using __MkDocs__.

          In parallel with those activities, I contributed to the setup of
          tooling for __Continuous Integration__ (CI), such as:

            * Automatic provisioning and deployment of __Gitlab
              Runners__,
            * Setup of standard CI jobs around various CNRS projects for
              instance to deploy automatically documentation, run tests and
              linters.


          I also offered internal training in the laboratory about __Git__
          and about data security (__gpg__, __KeepassXC__, Hard Drive
          Encryption).

          ##### Description {.subtitle}

          Realization of a __research project__ associated to the __ANR
          SoLSTiCE project__ aiming to develop new models and tools to
          represent 2D (images) and 2D+t (videos, cellular automata) data.


          During that time, I went from almost zero knowledge on the subject
          of data mining to the implement of new algorithm which I compared
          to the current state-of-the-art.


          This project led me to my thesis defense called
          __Spatio-temporal grid mining applied to image classification and
          cellular automata analysis__.

          ##### Responsibilities {.subtitle}

          The main activities I had were:

            * __Development__ of tools and algorithm to perform grid mining,
              which is a subset of graph mining,
            * __Plan__ and perform data experimentations,
            * Reading and understanding of many research papers on the subject,
            * __Autonomous work__.
