  IT enthusiast, kinda weird, living in the terminal, Iâ€™m focused on cloud
  platform administration, automation and observability.

  I love everything related to IaC tools and automation through GitOps approach
  to ensure traceability of deployment evolution, scalability and reconciliation
  when drifts occur.

  I also pay a lot of attention to my volunteer investments and my commitment to
  security and data privacy.
